(1) convert the distances into FRET efficiency using script cal_E_dist.py

(2) open.input is the input file. It has the following format:
# Line 1 : y_exp, sigma
#          - y_exp = experimental mean (μ)
#          - sigma = experimental standard deviation (σ)
#
# Line 2+ : one float per line
#           Each value is the simulated observable (FRET effciency) from one AlphaFold model

(3) direct_fitting.py: “Match a smoothed histogram (RBF) to a Gaussian using L2/QP.” Smooth, convex, tunable. 
RBF: Smoothly represent the distribution using Gaussian-shaped basis functions instead of sharp bins. L2: Measure the mismatch between reweighted and target distribution with squared error. QP: Solve the optimization problem with convex programming under probability constraints.
